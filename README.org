This started out as a clone of Nano Emacs, but at this point, I'm just using
this as a way to figure out lisps.

Some of the goals I have for this exercise include

1) Minimal calls to external package repositories from elpa and melpa and
   maximize the use of Emacs' builtin packages
2) Portability between OSs and systems
3) Improving the UI and interaction schema for Emacs.
   - Part of this is my custom theme. Rule of thumb here is to minimize
     definition of custom faces. Only customize a face if it sucks or doesn't
     know how to inherit from default Emacs faces.
   - A more modern(? To be defined) way of interacting with the mini-buffer.
   - Child-frames for completions ala posframe.
   - Adding context where possible.
   - Providing easy access to help & documentation.

* Progress
- [X] Bare-bones setup to build from.
- [X] Bare-bones recreation of [[https://github.com/skye-repos/TransSide-theme][my old theme]].
- Replace the use of the follow packages with builtin packages
  - [ ] package-lint (possible?).
  - [ ] expreg (my prototype sucks, expreg is better and uses the builtin
    treesit.el. Maybe some heavily cut down version?).
  - [ ] magit (vc-mode seems good. Maybe combine transient with it?).
  - [ ] vertico-posframe (either tie it in with the logic for the mini-buffer or
    use this for the mini-buffer echo messages).
  - [ ] org-modern (there has to be an easier way?).
- Add the following functionality
  - [ ] Treating the mini-buffer as a transient child frame.
  - [ ] LSP stuff with eglot.
- [ ] Simple mode-line (must be from scratch).

* Installation

Make sure you have libenchant installed. [[https://github.com/minad/jinx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][You can follow the instructions here.]]
and then just git clone into the =user-emacs-directory=
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/skye-repos/thetasigma-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

You can launch Emacs now (or restart the daemon) and it should work. The first
start may take a bit to pull in all the packages (will be minimized eventually)
