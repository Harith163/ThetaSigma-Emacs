* Θ Σ Emacs
I've been using nano-emacs for some time now as bones for my own config. When
delving into it, I realised that most of my interaction with emacs comes from
packages not considered in nano.

This is my attempt to create the default-user experience I would expect in
emacs. Hence, Emacs for (Me)macs.

This is a work-in-progress.

* Installation

For the time being, just git clone into the =user-emacs-directory=
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/skye-repos/thetasigma-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d/thetasigma-emacs
#+end_src

Then load it in through the user =init.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

  (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
  (unless(file-exists-p custom-file)
    (write-file custom-file) (load-file custom-file))
  (load-file custom-file)

  ;; Use-package basics
  (setopt use-package-always-ensure t)
  (unless (and (string> emacs-version "30")
               (package-installed-p 'vc-use-package))
    (package-vc-install "https://github.com/slotThe/vc-use-package"))

  (use-package thetasigma
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/thetasigma-emacs/")

  ;; Not necessary but recommended
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil
                      :family "Fira Code"
                      :height 140)

#+end_src
