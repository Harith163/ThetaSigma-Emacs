* Θ Σ Emacs
I've been using nano-emacs for some time now as bones for my own config. When delving into it, I realised that most of my interaction with emacs comes from packages not considered in nano.

This is my attempt to create the default-user experience I would expect in emacs. Hence, Emacs for (Me)macs.

This is a work-in-progress.

* Installation

For the time being, just git clone into the =user-emacs-directory=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/skye-repos/thetasigma-emacs.git
#+end_src 

Then load it in through the user =init.el=.

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "thetasigma-emacs/"))
  (package-initialize)
  (require 'thetasigma)
#+end_src
