* Θ Σ Emacs
I've been using nano-emacs for some time now as bones for my own config. When
delving into it, I realised that most of my interaction with emacs comes from
packages not considered in nano.

This is my attempt to create the default-user experience I would expect in
emacs. Hence, Emacs for (Me)macs.

This is a work-in-progress.

* Installation

For the time being, just git clone into the =user-emacs-directory=
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/skye-repos/thetasigma-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src
